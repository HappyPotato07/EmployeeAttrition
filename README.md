This project aims to build a data-driven classification model to identify employees at risk of attrition within Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). By analyzing employee work-life balance, satisfaction data, and other influential factors, the model can provide SMEs with actionable insights to improve employee retention strategies. The project uses algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines, and ensembles methods such as stacking alongside Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure interpretability of predictions. This approach not only aids in reducing turnover costs but also aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting decent work and economic growth in resource-limited SME environments.
