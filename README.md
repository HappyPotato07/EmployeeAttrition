This project aims to build a data-driven classification model to identify employees at risk of attrition within Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). The primary goal of this research is to enable HR teams to implement targeted retention strategies by leveraging machine learning models, ultimately reducing turnover costs and fostering sustainable workforce management. The project involves critical components, including data collection, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Historical employee data is preprocessed and analyzed to identify patterns in factors such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and compensation. Machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and ensembled methods (Bagging & STacking) are implemented and compared to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting attrition. Explainable AI (XAI) and LIME techniques are integrated to ensure that the model's predictions are interpretable and actionable.

Stacking was chosen as the best-performing model, offering a strong balance of accuracy and generalizability with 96.22% accuracy. A key strength of this research is the integration of XAI, which adds a layer of transparency to the predictions, enabling HR teams to understand the primary factors driving attrition. This study also emphasizes the alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting decent work and economic growth in SMEs through improved workforce stability. 

By combining robust model comparisons, actionable insights, and interpretable predictions, this project advances the application of machine learning in employee retention, offering a valuable tool for SMEs to address attrition challenges efficiently.
