This project aims to build a data-driven classification model to identify employees at risk of attrition within Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). By analyzing employee work-life balance, satisfaction data, and other influential factors, the model can provide SMEs with actionable insights to improve employee retention strategies. The project leverages machine learning and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure transparency and interpretability in model predictions, aiding HR professionals in making informed decisions to mitigate attrition.
